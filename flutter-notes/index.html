	<h1>Flutter/Dart Notes</h1>
	<p>Will be updated when I have structured my notes taken while learning about Flutter and Dart. It's a <a href="notes.html" target="_blank">work in progress</a> for now.</p>
	<p>The HTML is extremely messy because it's generated from my notes, through a hastily developed parser.</p>
